- Scanner in deadloop on input 'let y = 2 in "sin on y;'
- fix imports and type hinting
- Implement better syntax warnings
- Rewrite the scanner
- Implement map, fold and filter
- debug interpreter on (lambda x . lambda y . x + y) on 1, 2
- implement caching for ast.execute() calls
- implement function application by argument juxtaposition
- reimplement caching by converting sets to tuples so they can be hashed
- make intersection code nicer
- debug
    let a = let b = 2 in b in c
    let b = 2 in b
for bound_variable code
